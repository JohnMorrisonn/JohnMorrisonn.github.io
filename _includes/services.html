                    I am currently a Data Science student at Lambda School, an accelerated full-time program, preparing for work
                    in a Data Scientist or Data Engineering position. My different background of Biology focus on Neuroscience and years
                    of customer service have helped me prepare for the analytical challenges I am looking forward to, and the fullfillment of
                    working in a team setting or being able to present to others.
